# Top 10 Tips for Perfect Wedding Photos

Your wedding day is one of the most important days of your life, and you want to ensure your photos capture every precious moment. Here are our top 10 tips for getting the best wedding photos possible.

## 1. Choose the Right Photographer

This might seem obvious, but it's crucial. Look through portfolios, meet with potential photographers, and choose someone whose style resonates with you and who you feel comfortable around.

## 2. Create a Shot List

While your photographer will capture candid moments, having a list of must-have shots (family groupings, specific details, etc.) ensures nothing important is missed.

## 3. Plan for Golden Hour

The hour before sunset provides the most beautiful natural light. Schedule your couple's portraits during this time for magical results.

## 4. Stay Hydrated and Relaxed

Stressed faces don't photograph well! Take moments throughout the day to breathe, hydrate, and enjoy the experience.

## 5. Consider a First Look

A first look can ease nerves, provide a private moment, and allow more time for photos before the ceremony.

## 6. Trust Your Photographer

You hired a professional for a reason. Trust their direction and recommendations—they know how to make you look your best.

## 7. Focus on Each Other

The best photos happen when you're focused on each other, not the camera. Let genuine moments and emotions shine through.

## 8. Prepare Details in Advance

Have all your details (rings, shoes, invitations, etc.) ready for detail shots before getting dressed.

## 9. Allow Enough Time

Don't rush your photo timeline. Rushing leads to stress, which shows in photos. Build in buffer time.

## 10. Enjoy the Moment

Remember, these photos are meant to capture your joy and love. Relax, have fun, and be present in each moment.
