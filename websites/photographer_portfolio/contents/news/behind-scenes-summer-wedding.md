# Behind the Scenes: Summer Wedding Season

Summer is our busiest season, and we absolutely love it! Today, we're pulling back the curtain to show you what goes into capturing beautiful wedding moments.

## The Preparation

### Equipment Check

Before every wedding, we meticulously check our equipment:
- Multiple camera bodies (backups are essential!)
- Various lenses for different situations
- Extra batteries and memory cards
- Lighting equipment for reception
- Emergency repair kit

### Timeline Planning

We work closely with couples to create a detailed timeline that allows for:
- Proper lighting conditions
- Sufficient time for family portraits
- Golden hour couple shots
- Candid moments throughout the day

## On the Wedding Day

### Early Arrival

We typically arrive 1-2 hours before the ceremony to:
- Capture getting-ready moments
- Photograph details (dress, shoes, rings, flowers)
- Scout ceremony and reception locations
- Test lighting conditions

### The Ceremony

During the ceremony, we position ourselves strategically to capture:
- The processional
- Emotional reactions
- Exchange of vows and rings
- The first kiss
- The recessional

We work quietly and unobtrusively, ensuring we don't distract from the moment.

### Reception Coverage

At the reception, we focus on:
- DÃ©cor and table settings
- Guest interactions
- Speeches and toasts
- First dance and parent dances
- Cake cutting
- Dance floor energy

## Post-Production Magic

After the wedding, the real work begins:
- Sorting through thousands of images
- Selecting the best shots
- Color correction and enhancement
- Retouching when needed
- Creating a cohesive gallery

## The Result

Each wedding requires approximately 40-60 hours of work from start to finish, but seeing the joy on our couples' faces when they receive their photos makes it all worthwhile.
