Sarah and Michael's wedding was a dream come true. Set in the heart of Napa Valley, their garden ceremony took place during the perfect golden hour, with vineyard views stretching as far as the eye could see.

## The Details

Every element was thoughtfully curated, from the blush and ivory floral arrangements to the hand-calligraphed place cards. The couple chose a romantic garden aesthetic that perfectly complemented the natural beauty of the venue.

### Ceremony Highlights

The ceremony took place under a floral-adorned arbor, with white garden roses and trailing greenery creating a stunning natural frame. As Sarah walked down the aisle, the soft evening light filtered through the trees, creating an ethereal atmosphere.

### Reception Magic

The reception featured long farmhouse tables adorned with candles and seasonal blooms. String lights overhead created a warm glow as guests danced into the evening. The couple's first dance under the stars was a moment of pure magic.
