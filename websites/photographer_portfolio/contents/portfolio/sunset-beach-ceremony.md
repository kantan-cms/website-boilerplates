## The Vision

Emma and David wanted an intimate beach wedding that captured the essence of their love for the ocean. They chose a secluded Malibu beach for their ceremony, with only their closest family and friends in attendance.

## The Day

As the sun began its descent toward the horizon, the couple exchanged vows with their toes in the sand. The sound of waves crashing provided a natural soundtrack, while the golden light created the most beautiful, warm glow.

### Ceremony Details

The minimalist ceremony setup featured a simple driftwood arch decorated with white orchids and flowing fabric that danced in the ocean breeze. The bride wore a flowing bohemian gown that moved beautifully with the wind.

### Capturing the Moments

The natural beauty of the setting required minimal intervention. We focused on capturing candid momentsâ€”the couple's laughter, the way the light caught Emma's veil, and the emotional reactions of their loved ones.

## The Result

The resulting images are timeless and romantic, perfectly capturing the spirit of Emma and David's love story against the stunning California coastline.
